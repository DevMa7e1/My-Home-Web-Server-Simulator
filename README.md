<b>My Home Web Server Simulator is a simple but fun game where you can experience and learn about hosting a website, but without any of the real-world complications! Start from a little ESP-01 and expand to Raspberry Pis, PCs and maybe even the cloud.</b><br><br>

<p>This game was built using the Unity game engine and is written in C#.<br>
